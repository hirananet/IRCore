# IRCore

Angular IRC Core services.

This library is an IRC client for Angular/typescript, uses websocket or kiwiircgateway for connections.
Most of the events are handled in two ways, one is using Observer pattern via static handlers classes, and another is using angular services.

This library works fine with Inspircd and Anope (not tested this version in atheme).
